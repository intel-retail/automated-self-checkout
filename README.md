## 🚀 QuickStart

(If this is the first time, it will take some time to download videos, models, docker images and build images)

This command will run a basic DLStreamer pipeline doing Object Detection using YOLOv5s INT8 model on CPU:

```
make run-demo
```

Recently added YoloV8 to the pipeline. To run YoloV8 on the pipeline, please use the following code-snippet.

```
make YOLO=yolov8 run-demo
```

The pipeline currently only supports YoloV5 and YoloV8.

stop containers:

```
make down
```

### Run pipeline on iGPU

```
DEVICE_ENV=res/all-gpu.env make run-demo
```

```
make down
```

### Run pipeline with classification model on iGPU

```
PIPELINE_SCRIPT=yolov5s_effnetb0.sh DEVICE_ENV=res/all-gpu.env make run-demo
```
