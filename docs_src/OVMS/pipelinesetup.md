# Set up Pipeline

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout.git && cd ./automated-self-checkout
```

### Step 2: Build profile launcher

To build the profile-launcher binary executable, just use `make build-profile-launcher` from the command line.

Each profile is an unique pipeline use case.  We provide some profile examples, and the configuration examples of profiles [are located here](https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout/tree/main/configs/opencv-ovms/cmd_client/res).  [Go here](profileLauncherConfigs.md) to find out the detail descriptions for the configuration of profile used by profile launcher.

!!! Note Optional to install Golang 1.20

For the development debugging purpose like running and debugging in IDE, you may want to install Golang 1.20. Here is [the link to download](https://go.dev/dl/) Golang.

Follow the [installation instruction](https://go.dev/doc/install#Go_installation) with the same downloaded file name above for version 1.20.

### Step 3: Build the benchmark Docker images

For use cases that support benchmarking, build the benchmark Docker images:

```bash
cd benchmark-scripts
make build-all
```

### Step 4: Download the models manually (Optional)

When `run.sh` the Model downloader script is automatically called. the model downloader script is automatically called as part of run-ovms.sh (part of run.sh). You can also download the models manually using the model downloader script:

```bash
sh ./download_models/getModels.sh --workload ovms
```

!!! Note
    Depending on your internet connection, this might take less than a minute.


### Step 5: Download image file Manually (Optional)

The sample image downloader script is automatically called as part of run-ovms.sh. You can also download the sample image manually using script below:

```bash
sh ./configs/opencv-ovms/scripts/image_download.sh 
```

!!! Note
    Depending on your internet connection, this might take less than a minute.


### Step 6: Download bit model Manually (optional)

Here is the script to build container for bit model downloading:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.bitModel -t bit_model_downloader:dev .
```

Here is the script to run container and downloads the bit models:

```bash
docker run -it bit_model_downloader:dev
```

### Step 7: Build the reference design images

You must build the provided component services and create local docker images. Below is the table for the OVMS Server and Client build command:

| Target                            | Docker Build Command               | Check Success                                                          |
| ----------------------------------| -----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OVMS Server                       | <pre>make build-ovms-server</pre>  | docker images command to show <b>openvino/model_server-gpu:latest</b>  |
|                                   |                                    | docker images command to show <b>openvino/model_server:latest-gpu</b>  |
|                                   |                                    | docker images command to show <b>openvino/model_server:latest</b>      |
|                                   |                                    | docker images command to show <b>openvino/model_server-pkg:latest</b>  |
|                                   |                                    | docker images command to show <b>openvino/model_server-build:latest</b>|
| OVMS Profile Launcher             | <pre>make build-profile-launcher</pre>  | <b>ls -al ./profile-launcher</b> command to show the binary executable                |

!!! Note
    Build command may take a while, depending on your internet connection and machine specifications.

!!! Note
    If the build command succeeds, you will see all the built Docker images files as indicated in the **Check Success** column. If the build fails, check the console output for errors.

!!! Proxy
    If docker build system requires a proxy network, just set your proxy env standard way on your terminal as below and make build:

    ```bash
    export HTTP_PROXY="http://your-proxy-url.com:port"
    export HTTPS_PROXY="https://your-proxy-url.com:port"
    make build-ovms-server
    make build-profile-launcher
    ```
