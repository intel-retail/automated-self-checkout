# Profile Configuration

For the profile launcher, each profile has its own configuration for different pipelines.  The configuration of each profile is done through a yaml configuration file, configuration.yaml.  One example of configuration.yaml is [shown here for classification profile](https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout/blob/main/configs/opencv-ovms/cmd_client/res/classification/configuration.yaml):

```yaml
OvmsSingleContainer: false
OvmsServer:
  ServerDockerScript: start_ovms_server.sh
  ServerDockerImage: openvino/model_server:2023.1-gpu
  ServerContainerName: ovms-server
  ServerConfig: "/models/config.json"
  StartupMessage: Starting OVMS server
  InitWaitTime: 10s
  EnvironmentVariableFiles:
    - ovms_server.env
  # StartUpPolicy:
  # when there is an error on launching ovms server startup, choose one of these values for the behavior of profile-launcher: 
  #   remove-and-restart: it will remove the existing container with the same container name if any and then restart the container
  #   exit: it will exit the profile-launcher and 
  #   ignore: it will ignore the error and continue (this is the default value if not given or none of the above)
  StartUpPolicy: ignore    
OvmsClient:
  DockerLauncher:
    Script: docker-launcher.sh
    DockerImage: python-demo:dev
    ContainerName: classification
    Volumes:
      - "$RUN_PATH/results:/tmp/results"
      - ~/.Xauthority:/home/dlstreamer/.Xauthority
      - /tmp/.X11-unix
  PipelineScript: ./classification/python/entrypoint.sh
  PipelineInputArgs: "" # space delimited like we run the script in command and take those input arguments
  EnvironmentVariableFiles:
    - classification.env
```

The description of each configuration element is explained below:

---

| Configuration Element                   | Description                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| OvmsSingleContainer     | This boolean flag indicates whether this profile is running as a single OpenVino Model Server (OVMS) container or not, e.g. the C-API pipeline use case will use this as `true`. <br>It can indicate the distributed architecture of OVMS client-server when this flag is false. </br>  |
| OvmsServer                           | This is configuration section for OpenVino Model Server in the case of client-server architecture. |
| OvmsServer/ServerDockerScript        | The infra-structure shell script to start an instance of OVMS server.  |
| OvmsServer/ServerDockerImage         | The Docker image tag name for OpenVino Model Server.  |
| OvmsServer/ServerContainerName       | The Docker container base name for OpenVino Model Server.  |
| OvmsServer/ServerConfig              | The model config.json file name path for OpenVino Model Server.  |
| OvmsServer/StartupMessage            | The starting message shown in the console or log when OpenVino Model Server instance is launched. |
| OvmsServer/InitWaitTime              | The waiting time duration (like 5s, 5m, .. etc) after OpenVino Model Server is launched to allow some settling time before launching the pipeline from the client. |
| OvmsServer/EnvironmentVariableFiles  | The list of environment variable files applied for starting OpenVino Model Server Docker instance. |
| OvmsServer/StartUpPolicy             | This configuration controls the behavior of OpenVino Model Server Docker instance when there is error occurred during launching. <br>Use one of these values:</br>  `remove-and-restart`: it will remove the existing container with the same container name if any and then restart the container <br> `exit`: it will exit the profile-launcher <br>`ignore`: it will ignore the error and continue (this is the default value if not given or none of the above). </br> |
| OvmsClient                           | This is configuration section for the OVMS client running pipelines in the case of client-server architecture. <br>The C-API pipeline use case should also use this section to configure. |
| OvmsClient/DockerLauncher            | This is configuration section for the generic Docker launcher to run pipelines for a given profile. |
| OvmsClient/DockerLauncher/Script        | The generic Docker launcher script file name. |
| OvmsClient/DockerLauncher/DockerImage   | The Docker image tag name for the pipeline profile. |
| OvmsClient/DockerLauncher/ContainerName | The Docker container base name for the running pipeline profile. |
| OvmsClient/DockerLauncher/Volumes       | The Docker container volume mounts for the running pipeline profile. |
| OvmsClient/PipelineScript               | The file name path for the pipeline profile to launch. The file path here is in the perspective of the running container. i.e. the path inside the running container. |
| OvmsClient/PipelineInputArgs            | Any input arguments or parameters for the above pipeline script to take. Like any command line argument, they are space-delimited if multiple arguments. |
| OvmsClient/EnvironmentVariableFiles     | The list of environment variable files applied for the running pipeline profile Docker instance. |
