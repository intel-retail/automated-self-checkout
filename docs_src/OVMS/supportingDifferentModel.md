# Support Different Model
For running OVMS as inferencing engine through grpc, we are supporting different models for your need. 

## Models Supported In Python
Here is the list of inferencing models we are currently supporting in python:

1. instance-segmentation-security-1040
2. bit_64

You can switch between them by editing the configuration file `configs/opencv-ovms/cmd_client/res/grpc_python/configuration.yaml`, uncomment `# PipelineInputArgs: "--model_name instance-segmentation-security-1040"` for supporting instance-segmentation-security-1040 and comment out rest; or you can uncomment `# PipelineInputArgs: "--model_name bit_64"` for supporting bit_64 and comment out rest.

Here is the configuration.yaml content, default to use `instance-segmentation-security-1040` model
```
OvmsClient:
  PipelineScript: run_grpc_python.sh
  PipelineInputArgs: "--model_name instance-segmentation-security-1040" # space delimited like we run the script in command and take those input arguments
  # PipelineInputArgs: "--model_name bit_64" # space delimited like we run the script in command and take those input arguments
  # PipelineInputArgs: "--model_name yolov5s" # space delimited like we run the script in command and take those input arguments

```

## Download Models
You can download models by editing `download_models/models.lst` file, you can add new models(from https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/demos/object_detection_demo/python/models.lst) to it or uncomment from existing list in this file, saved the file once editing is done. Then you can download the list using following steps:

1. `cd download_models`
2. `make build`
3. `make run`

after above steps, the downloaded models can be found in `configs/opencv-ovms/models/2022` directory.
**_Note:_** model files in `configs/opencv-ovms/models/2022` directory will be replaced with new downloads if previously existed.
