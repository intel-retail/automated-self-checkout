# Vision Self Checkout

## Introduction
This guide helps you build and run the Vision Self Checkout solution.

Upon completing the steps in this guide, you will be ready to run and benchmark pipelines on different hardware setups.

### Overview

The Vision Self Checkout solution is a set of pre-configured pipelines that are optimized for performance on Intel. The pipelines run several models including yolov5s, efficientnet-b0, horizontal-test-detection-002, and text-recognitiion-0012-gpu. Details about the pipelines and how to run them can be found [HERE](./pipelinesetup.md)

A set of branchmarking tools have been provided to demonstrate the performance of the pipelines on Intel hardware. Once you have completed the [pipeline setup steps](./pipelinesetup.md) you will be able to run benchmark by following these [steps](./benchmark.md)
