# Automated Self Checkout

## Overview

The Intel® Automated Self-Checkout Retail Reference Software provides critical components required to build and deploy a self-checkout use case using Intel® hardware, software, and other open-source software. This reference implementation provides a pre-configured automated self checkout pipeline that is optimized for Intel® hardware.  The reference solution also includes a set of benchmarking tools to evaluate the workload on different hardware platforms. Together the reference solution will help evaluate your required hardware to minimize the cost per workload.
