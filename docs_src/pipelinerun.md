# Pipeline Run

## Prerequisites: 
Pipeline setup needs to be done first following the documentation found [HERE](./pipelinesetup.md).

---
## Introduction to Pipeline run flow and expectation
The pipeline run starts the service and perform inferencing on the selected input media. The output of the pipeline run provides the inference results for each frame regarding the media source such as text, barcode, etc; as well as the FPS (frames per second). Pipeline run provides many options in media type, system process platform type, and additional optional parameters. These options give you the opportunity to compare what system process platform is better for your need.

### Run options

1. Media type input choice for pipeline run:
    - camera simulator using rtsf
    - realsense camera
    - USB camera
    - video file
2. Process platform type input choice:
    - core
    - dgpu.0
    - dgpu.1
    - xeon
3. More optional parameters, see [Optional parameters](#optional-parameters) section for detail.

You have to get your choices for #1, #2, #3 above to start the pipeline run, see [details](#run-pipeline-with-different-input-sourceinputsrc-types) section below.

### Check successful pipeline run
Once pipeline run has started, you will expect containers to be running, see [check for pipeline run success](#check-for-pipeline-run-success); For a successful run, you should expect results/ directory filled with log files and you can watch these log files grow, see [sample output log files](#sample-output).

### Stop pipeline run
You can call `make clean-all` to stop the pipeline and all running containers, hence the results directory log files will stop growing. Below is the table of make commands you can call to clean things up per your needs:

| Clean Containers Options                          | Command                         |
| --------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------|
| clean simulator containers                        | <pre>make clean-simulator</pre> |
| clean sco-* containers                            | <pre>make clean</pre>           |
| clean both simulator and self-checkout containers | <pre>make clean-all</pre>       |

---
## Run camera simulator
Before running the below (e.g. starting the camera-simulator.sh) ensure you have downloaded video file(s) to the `sample-media` directory. Execute the commands 
```bash
cd benchmark-scripts; sudo ./download_sample_videos.sh; cd ..;
``` 
These commands are provided as an option to download a sample video(s) and RTSP stream with the camera-simulator.  You can also specify the desired resolution and framerate e.g.
```bash
cd benchmark-scripts; sudo ./download_sample_videos.sh 1920 1080 15; cd ..;
```
for 1080p@15fps. Note that only AVC encoded files are supported.

Once video files are copied/downloaded to the sample-media folder, start the camera simulator from automated-self-checkout/ directory with:
```bash
make run-camera-simulator
``` 

!!!Note Please wait for few seconds, then use below command to check if camera-simulator containers are running.
```bash
docker ps --format 'table{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Names}}'
```

!!! success
    Your output is as follows:

| IMAGE                                              | STATUS                   | NAMES             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |-------------------|
| openvino/ubuntu20_data_runtime:2021.4.2            | Up 11 seconds            | camera-simulator0 |
| aler9/rtsp-simple-server                           | Up 13 seconds            | camera-simulator  |

!!!Note there could be multiple containers with IMAGE "openvino/ubuntu20_data_runtime:2021.4.2", depending on number of sample-media video file you have.

!!! failure
    If you do not see all of the above docker containers, look through the console output for errors. Sometimes dependencies fail to resolve and must be run again. Address obvious issues. To try again, repeat [Run camera simulator](#run-camera-simulator).

## Run pipeline with different input source(inputsrc) types
Use docker-run.sh to run the pipeline, here is the table of basic scripts for each combination:

| Input source Type | scripts                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| simulated camera  | <code>sudo ./docker-run.sh --platform core&#124;xeon&#124;dgpu.x --inputsrc rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/camera_0</code>|
| realsense camera  | <code>sudo ./docker-run.sh --platform core&#124;xeon&#124;dgpu.x --inputsrc <serial_number> --realsense_enabled</code>        |
| USB camera        | <code>sudo ./docker-run.sh --platform core&#124;xeon&#124;dgpu.x --inputsrc /dev/video0</code>                         |
| a video file      | <code>sudo ./docker-run.sh --platform core&#124;xeon&#124;dgpu.x --inputsrc file:my_video_file.mp4</code>             |

!!!Note for `dgpu.x`, the x can be 0, 1, 2, ... depends on how many discrete gpu it has in the system

---
## Optional parameters
The optional parameters you can apply to the docker-run.sh input, just note that they will affect the performance of pipeline run.

### `--classification_disabled`
To disable classification process of image extraction when applying model, default is NOT disabling classification if this is not provided as input to docker-run.sh

### `--ocr_disabled`
To disable Optical character recognition when applying model, default is NOT disabling ocr if this is not provided as input to docker-run.sh

### `--ocr`

Check inference results and use case performance
```bash
ls -l results
```

This directory contains pipeline*.log files for each pipeline/workload that is running and is the pipeline/workload current FPS (throughput) results.

This directory also contains r*.jsonl for each of pipeline/workload that is running and is the pipeline/workload inference results.


!!! Failure
    If you do not see above Docker container(s), review the console output for errors. Sometimes dependencies fail to resolve and must be run again. Address obvious issues and try again repeating the above steps.

```

### results/pipeline0.log sample:

The output in results/pipeline0.log file lists FPS (frames per second) during pipeline run. Below is a sample snapshot of the log file:

```text
27.34
27.34
27.60
27.60
28.30
28.30
28.61
28.61
28.48
28.48
