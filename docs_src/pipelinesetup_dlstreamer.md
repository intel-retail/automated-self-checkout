# Set up Pipeline

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout.git && cd ./automated-self-checkout
    ```

2. For use cases that support benchmarking, build the benchmark containers:

    ```bash
    cd benchmark-scripts
    make build-all
    ```

3. Download the models manually **(optional)**.

    !!! Note
        When `run.sh` the Model downloader script is automatically called.

    ```bash
    sh modelDownload.sh
    ```

    !!! Warning
        This step might take a while as the script will download several models for the first time.
    
    !!! Note
        For the list of pre-trained models, refer to the [Model List](https://github.com/intel-retail/automated-self-checkout/blob/main/configs/dlstreamer/models/2022/models.list.yml).

4. Build the reference design Docker* images. You must build the provided component services and create local docker images. The following table lists the build command for various platforms. Choose and run the command corresponding to your platforms or hardware.
    
    | Platform                                       | Docker Build Command                       | Check Success                                                |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Intel platforms using DLStreamer               | <pre>make build-dlstreamer</pre>           | docker images command to show <b>sdlstreamer:dev</b>         |
    | Intel platforms using DLStreamer and Realsense | <pre>make build-dlstreamer-realsense</pre> |  docker images command to show <b>sdlstreamer:realsense</b>  |

    !!! Warning
        Build command may take a while, depending on your internet connection and machine specifications.
    
    !!! Note
        If the build command succeeds, you will see all the built Docker images files as indicated in the **Check Success** column. If the build fails, check the console output for errors. The dependencies might have been unable to resolve. Address the issue and repeat [step 2](/pipelinesetup.md).
    
    !!! Proxy
        If the docker build system requires a proxy network, just set your proxy env standard way on your terminal as below and make build:
        ```bash
        export HTTP_PROXY="http://your-proxy-url.com:port"
        export HTTPS_PROXY="https://your-proxy-url.com:port"
        make build-all
        ```

## Next Steps

Run a [pipeline](./pipelinerun.md) or run a [benchmark for a pipeline](./pipelinebenchmarking.md).
